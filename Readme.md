# How to display and edit many-to-many objects from XPO XPView


<p><strong>Foreword</strong> It's not a good idea to edit many-to-many objects in one grid from the usability point of view. Usually, objects are modified individually. To link objects,  display a list of associated objects and Add / Remove buttons in a similar manner as a User Permissions dialog is implemented in Windows.</p><p>This example simply demonstrates how to load properties of a many-to-many association into the XPView component and display it in the ASPxGridView. In addition, the ASPxGridView.RowUpdating event is handled to allow a user to edit values displayed in the grid.</p>
